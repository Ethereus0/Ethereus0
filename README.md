## Hey everyone, Novalynx here!

I'm a tech enthusiast and content creator from Cyprus who fairs into tech and anime.

Other interests include but are not limited to:

- YTPMV and Crazy Error videos
- The Linux kernel
- Customization in general, whether it's the look and feel of an application or just tinkering with the settings
- Audio mixing
- Windows driver development

I make Crazy Error content from time to time but don't expect consistent uploads from me because I have a life.

I'm also learning reverse engineering, and I know HTML, SCSS/CSS, JS and C++
